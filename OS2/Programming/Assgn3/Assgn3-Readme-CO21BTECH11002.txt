OS2 Assignment 2

This program implements TAS, CAS, and Bounded Waiting CAS mutual waiting algorithms.
Input is given using command line argument. The program takes the name of file containing value of n (no. of threads) and k (no. of requests into CS) as input.

Executing TAS file:
(i) Compile the cpp file using following command:
g++ Assgn3-Src-tas-CO21BTECH11002.cpp -o Assgn3-Src-tas-CO21BTECH11002.out

(ii) Run the executable file with the name of input file as the command line argument using following command:
./Assgn3-Src-tas-CO21BTECH11002.out inp-params.txt


Executing CAS file:
(i) Compile the cpp file using following command:
g++ Assgn3-Src-cas-CO21BTECH11002.cpp -o Assgn3-Src-cas-CO21BTECH11002.out

(ii) Run the executable file with the name of input file as the command line argument using following command:
./Assgn3-Src-cas-CO21BTECH11002.out inp-params.txt


Executing Bounded CAS file:
(i) Compile the cpp file using following command:
g++ Assgn3-Src-cas-bounded-CO21BTECH11002.cpp -o Assgn3-Src-cas-bounded-CO21BTECH11002.out

(ii) Run the executable file with the name of input file as the command line argument using following command:
./Assgn3-Src-cas-bounded-CO21BTECH11002.out inp-params.txt
